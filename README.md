# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques.  Credit card fraud detection is a highly imbalanced classification problem the goal is to build a model that maximizes fraud detection (Recall) while minimizing false alarms (Precision).
